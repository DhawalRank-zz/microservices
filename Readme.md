Microservices using Spring Boot
==========================




Idea
-------------

The idea behind microservices is that some types of applications become easier to build and maintain when they are broken into smaller pieces which in turn work together. Each component is developed separately and, the application is simply the sum of individual components.
> **Note:**

> - UserApi app need to run first as it will be used by UserUI as a service.
> - Both apps can be imported individually in Eclipse or can be run from shell using Maven.
> - Fat JARs are recommended for packaging the application.
